          longer intervals,
          that is why we prepare for you the most reliable forecast in the whole internet !!! Air temperature is one of
          the basic meteorological elements determining the thermal state of the atmosphere.
          Data on air temperature are collected by meteorological stations. The measurement is made at a height of 2 m
          above the ground using a thermometer,
          sheltered from direct solar radiation in a meteorological cage. Maximum and minimum temperature are measured
          using separate thermometers
          - maximum and minimum thermometers, respectively.</div>

        <div class="functionality__description">Not only does it have a great impact on our well-being, but it is also a
          basis for predicting other weather ingredients.
          Atmospheric pressure, also known as barometric pressure (after the barometer), is the pressure within the
          atmosphere of Earth. The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm)
          is a unit of pressure defined as 101,325 Pa (1,013.25 hPa; 1,013.25 mbar), which is equivalent to 760 mm Hg,
          29.9212 inches Hg, or 14.696 psi.[1] The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric
          pressure on Earth, that is, the Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm.

        <h2 class="f__box">Wind</h2>
        <div class="functionality__description">Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On the surface of the Earth,
          wind consists of the bulk movement
          of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space,
          while planetary wind is the
          outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by
          their spatial scale,
          their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The
          strongest observed winds
          on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind
          speed);
          the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy. Wind is also an important means of
          transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.</div>

        <h2 class="f__box">Wave height</h2>
        <div class="functionality__description">In physical oceanography, the significant wave height (SWH or Hs) is
          defined traditionally as
          the mean wave height (trough to crest) of the highest third of the waves (H1/3). Nowadays it is usually
          defined as four times
          the standard deviation of the surface elevation – or equivalently as four times the square root of the
          zeroth-order moment
          (area) of the wave spectrum. The symbol Hm0 is usually used for that latter definition. The significant wave
          height may
          thus refer to Hm0 or Hs; the difference in magnitude between the two definitions is only a few percent.</div>

        <div class="functionality__image"><img class="img__box" src="./img/claudcover.png" alt="cloud baner"></div>
        <h2 class="f__box">Cloud cover</h2>
        <div class="functionality__description">Cloud cover (also known as cloudiness, cloudage, or cloud amount)
          refers to the fraction of the sky obscured by
          clouds when observed from a particular location. Okta is the usual unit of measurement of the cloud cover.
          The cloud cover is correlated
          to the sunshine duration as the least cloudy locales are the sunniest ones while the cloudiest areas are the
          least sunny places.
          The global cloud cover averages around 0.68 when analyzing clouds with optical depth larger than 0.1. This
          value is lower (0.56) when
          considering clouds with an optical depth larger than 2, and higher when counting subvisible cirrus clouds

        </div>
        <h2 class="f__box">Precipitation</h2>
        <div class="functionality__description">In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of
          atmospheric water vapour
          that falls under gravity from clouds. The main forms of precipitation include drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, ice
          pellets, graupel
          and hail. Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor (reaching
          100% relative
          humidity), so that the water condenses and "precipitates". Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but
          suspensions,
          because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate. Two processes, possibly acting
          together, can
          lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation forms as
          smaller droplets
          coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud. Short, intense periods of rain in
          scattered
          locations are called "showers."</div>

        </div>
        <h2 class="f__box">Sea surface temperature</h2>
        <div class="functionality__description">Sea surface temperature (SST) is the water temperature close to the
          ocean's surface.
          The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between 1 millimetre
          (0.04 in) and
          20 metres (70 ft) below the sea surface. Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea
          surface temperatures
          within a short distance of the shore. Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water
          bodies within
          an otherwise cold air mass. Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of tropical cyclogenesis
          over the
          Earth's oceans. Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper 30 metres
          (100 ft)
          of the ocean. SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST
          variation on
          breezy days than on calm days. In addition, ocean currents such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
          (AMO),
          can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales,[4] a major impact results from the global thermohaline
          circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.</div>

      <div class="functionality__box">
        <div class="functionality__image"><img class="img__box" src="./img/humidity.png" alt="humidity baner"></div>
        <h2 class="f__box">Humidity</h2>
        <div class="functionality__description">Humidity is the concentration of water vapour present in the air. Water
          vapour, the
          gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye. Humidity indicates the likelihood for
          precipitation,
          dew, or fog to be present. The amount of water vapour needed to achieve saturation increases as the
          temperature increases.
          As the temperature of a parcel of air decreases it will eventually reach the saturation point without adding
          or losing water mass. The amount of water vapour contained within a parcel of air can vary significantly. For
          example, a
          parcel of air near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic metre of air at 30 °C, but only 8 grams
          of water
          per cubic metre of air at 8 °C.</div>
